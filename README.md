# ARMulator

This project aims to produce a web-based application that allows users to input a subset
of ARM1 assembly instructions and visually execute and understand how the instructions are processed within the CPU registers and RAM . The motivation for this project
is to provide novice learners with a better understanding of how machine code is exe- cuted at the hardware level and how Assembly language works. Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is human-readable and has a strong corre- spondence to machine code instructions. Understanding Assembly language can help programmers write highly optimized and efficient code in high-level languages.
